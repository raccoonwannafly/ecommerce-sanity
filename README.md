# Ecommerce with NextJS & Sanity
#### Why Next.js?
- Next.js simplifies dev process
- Next.js offers middleware, parsing, auth.
- Optimizes web app
- SSR / CSR flexibility
- CSR SEO performance lower than SSR, but Next.js send pre-rendered code directly to Client.
This enables easy crawling & indexing => improve SEO => increased organic traffic, enhanced UX, credibility, competitive advantage
- Flexibility for fullstack: API Routes (serverless functions to handle API reqs)
- Serverless comes with several benefits of managing infrastructures and scalability as traffic increases.
- Improve HMR => better UX
- In React you have to use lazy function & suspense component, but Next.js automatically split codes into seperate chunks by default.
When user navigate to a page only code for that page loads.
- In React you have to use nested routing, Next.js use simple and comprehensive file-based routing system.
- Linting, Formatting, Compiling, Bundling, Minifying, Deploying, ... simplifed with Next.js
